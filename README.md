This is a simple feedback app project that allows users to add, delete, and edit their feedback ratings.
It was made using React. This project uses a mock REST api with json server.
This project helped me solidify my understanding of the following React concepts:
- State(Components and App level)
- JSX
- Components
- Props (prototype and defaultprops, etc)
